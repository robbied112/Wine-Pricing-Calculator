# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Publishing your changes to GitHub

Run these commands from the project root (`/workspace/Wine-Pricing-Calculator`) in a terminal. If you open a fresh shell, `cd /workspace/Wine-Pricing-Calculator` first so Git can find the repository.

The project files in this workspace are not linked to a remote by default, so pushing a fresh update requires adding your GitHub repository and then publishing the current branch. A quick checklist:

1. Add your remote once: `git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/<repo>.git`
2. Confirm remotes: `git remote -v`
3. Ensure you are on the branch you want to publish: `git status` shows the current branch near the top.
4. Pull any upstream changes if collaborators have pushed since your last sync: `git fetch origin` followed by `git pull origin <branch>` (for example, `work` or `main`).
5. Commit your local work: `git status`, `git add <files>`, then `git commit -m "Describe your changes"`.
6. Push the branch to GitHub: `git push -u origin <branch>` on the first push, then `git push origin <branch>` for subsequent updates.

Once the push completes, GitHub will show the latest update time on the branch you pushed. If your default branch is `main`, open a pull request or push directly to keep the repository’s landing page in sync.
